   What is the rarest pet in Adopt Me? The Monkey King. It features red and gold armor, a feathered crown, and a
   staff for a tail.
   Pets were released in the June 2019 update (Summer Update); however, the "Pets" section of the backpack was added
   long before that. Hatching Eggs is the primary way of unlocking pets and operate similarly to Gifts but take
   longer to hatch. Players can also buy some specific types of pets using Robux 2019 Logo Black.svg Robux or event
   currencies. Pets can also be favorited by selecting them and clicking the star without holding them which causes
   it to equip the pet.

   New players who enter the Nursery for the first time will receive a free Starter Egg, which is only able to hatch
   into a Cat or a Dog, from Sir Woofington.
</p>

<h1>Types of Pets</h1>
There are 5 main types of pets in these ranks:
<br><br>

<p>
   Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra-Rare, and Legendary. The kind of pet
   players can hatch mostly depends on chance; the more expensive an egg is, the greater the chance players have of
   hatching rarer pets. There are currently 82 total pets players can hatch from eggs.

   Another type of pet is 'Event', which is a temporary pet that is removed from all inventories after period of
   time. The three event pets as of now are Scoob, Pumpkin (Pet), and 2D Kitty. Event pets age as fast as common
   pets, and in the inventory, they are classified with common items, pets, and vehicles. Although the Pet Rock
   wasn't an event pet, it was an uncommon pet. Event pets are not put on the nursery board, but the Pet Rock has.

   Players can only get Safari pets from the Safari Eggs; likewise, they can only get Jungle pets from Jungle Eggs.
   This pattern continues with other limited Eggs such as the Christmas Egg, Farm Egg, Aussie Egg, Fossil Egg, Ocean
   Egg, Mythic Egg, Woodland Egg, and Japan Egg.
