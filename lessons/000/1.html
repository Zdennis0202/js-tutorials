   <h1>Vesuvius facts</h1>

   <!-- content start -->

   <p>Mount Vesuvius (/vɪˈsuːviəs/ viss-OO-vee-əs; Italian: Vesuvio [veˈzuːvjo, -ˈsuː-]; Neapolitan: 'O Vesuvio [o
      vəˈsuːvjə], also 'A muntagna or 'A montagna; Latin: Vesuvius [wɛˈsʊwɪ.ʊs], also Vesevius, Vesvius or
      Vesbius is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about 9 km (5.6 mi) east of
      Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes forming the Campanian volcanic arc.
      Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera, resulting from the
      collapse of an earlier, much higher structure.
   </p>

   <p>The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis, Stabiae, and
      several other settlements. The eruption ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33 km
      (21 mi), erupting molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6×105 cubic metres (7.8×105 cu yd) per
      second. More than 1,000 people are thought to have died in the eruption, though the exact toll is unknown. The
      only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian
      Tacitus.
   </p>

   <p>Vesuvius has erupted many times since and is the only volcano on Europe's mainland to have erupted within the last
      hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population
      of 3,000,000 people living near enough to be affected by an eruption, with 600,000 in the danger zone, making
      it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world. It has a tendency towards violently explosive
      eruptions,
      which are now known as Plinian eruptions.
   </p>

   <p> Vesuvius has a long historic and literary tradition. It was considered a divinity of the Genius type at the time
      of the eruption of AD 79: it appears under the inscribed name Vesuvius as a serpent in the decorative frescos of
      many
      lararia, or household shrines, surviving from Pompeii. An inscription from Capua to IOVI VESVVIO indicates that he
      was worshipped as a power of Jupiter; that is, Jupiter Vesuvius.
   </p>

   <p>The Romans regarded Mount Vesuvius to be devoted to Hercules. The historian Diodorus Siculus relates a
      tradition that Hercules, in the performance of his labors, passed through the country of nearby Cumae on his way
      to Sicily and found there a place called "the Phlegraean Plain" (Φλεγραῖον πεδίον, "plain of fire"), "from a hill
      which anciently vomited out fire ... now called Vesuvius." It was inhabited by giant bandits, "the sons of the
      Earth. With the gods' assistance, he pacified the region and continued. The facts behind the tradition, if any,
      remain unknown, as does whether Herculaneum was named after it. An epigram by the poet Martial in 88 AD suggests
      that both Venus, patroness of Pompeii, and Hercules were worshipped in the region devastated by the eruption of
      79.
   </p>

   <p>Vesuvius was a name of the volcano in frequent use by the authors of the late Roman Republic and the early Roman
      Empire. Its collateral forms were Vesaevus, Vesevus, Vesbius and Vesvius. Writers in ancient Greek used
      Οὐεσούιον or Οὐεσούιος. Many scholars since then have offered an etymology. As peoples of varying ethnicity and
      language occupied Campania in the Roman Iron Age, the etymology depends to a large degree on the presumption of
      what language was spoken there at the time. Naples was settled by Greeks, as the name Nea-polis, "New City",
      testifies. The Oscans, an Italic people, lived in the countryside. The Latins also competed for the occupation of
      Campania. Etruscan settlements were in the vicinity. Other peoples of unknown provenance are said to have been
      there at some time by various ancient authors.
   </p>

   <p>Vesuvius is a "humpbacked" peak, consisting of a large cone (Gran Cono) partially encircled by the steep rim of a
      summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier (and originally much higher) structure called Mount Somma.
      The Gran Cono was produced during the A.D. 79 eruption. For this reason, the volcano is also called Somma-Vesuvius
      or Somma-Vesuvio.
   </p>

   <p>The caldera started forming during an eruption around 17,000–18,000 years ago[19][20][21] and was enlarged by
      later paroxysmal eruptions, ending in the one of AD 79. This structure has given its name to the term "somma
      volcano", which describes any volcano with a summit caldera surrounding a newer cone.
   </p>

   <p>The cliffs forming the northern ridge of Monte Somma's caldera rim reach a maximum height of 1,132 m (3,714 ft) at
      Punta Nasone. The summit of the main cone of Vesuvius is 1,281 m (4,203 ft) above sea level and more than 400 m
      (1,300 ft) above the 5 km (3.1 mi) long valley of Atrio di Cavallo (the northern floor of Monte Somma's caldera).

      The volcano's slopes are scarred by lava flows, while the rest are heavily vegetated, with scrub and forests at
      higher altitudes and vineyards lower down.</p>

   <p>Vesuvius is a stratovolcano and was formed as a result of the collision of two tectonic plates, the African and
      the Eurasian. The former was subducted at a convergent boundary beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the
      water-saturated sediments of the African oceanic plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water
      boiled off and lowered the melting point of the upper mantle enough to partially melt the rocks. Because magma is
      less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it
      broke through, thus forming the volcano.
   </p>

   <p>The volcano is one of several forming the Campanian volcanic arc. Others include Campi Flegrei, a large caldera a
      few kilometers to the north-west, Mount Epomeo, 20 kilometres (12 mi) to the west on the island of Ischia, and
      several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by
      the subduction process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as Monte Amiata
      in Southern Tuscany. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted in recent history, although some of the others have
      erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of
      years.
   </p>

   <p>Mount Vesuvius has erupted many times. Numerous others preceded the eruption in AD 79 in prehistory, including at
      least three significantly larger; an example is the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC, which engulfed several
      Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303,
      379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150,
      and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500. The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the
      18th century (including 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and
      1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive
      as the Pompeian one.

   </p>

   <p>The eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed Plinian
      after Pliny the Younger, a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the AD 79 eruption, including his
      uncle's death. On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has
      been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on Constantinople (Istanbul), over 1,200 kilometres (750
      mi) away. A few times since 1944, landslides in the crater have raised clouds of ash dust, raising false alarms of
      an eruption.
   </p>

   <p>Since 1750, seven of the eruptions of Vesuvius have had durations of more than five years; only Mount Etna has had
      as many long-duration eruptions in the last 270 years. The two most recent eruptions of Vesuvius (1875–1906
      and 1913–1944) each lasted more than 30 years.

      Vesuvius is still regarded as an active volcano, although its current activity produces little more than
      sulfur-rich steam from vents at the bottom and walls of the crater.

      Layers of lava, ash, scoria and pumice make up the volcanic peak. Their mineralogy is variable, but generally
      silica-undersaturated and rich in potassium, with phonolite produced in the more explosive eruption (e.g. the
      eruption in 1631 displaying a complete stratigraphic and petrographic description: phonolite was firstly erupted,
      followed by a tephritic phonolite and finally a phonolitic tephrite).
   </p>

   <p>According to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program, Vesuvius has had 54 confirmed eruptions
      during the Holocene Epoch (the last 11,700 years). A volcanic explosivity index (VEI) has been assigned to all but
      one of these eruptions.
   </p>

   <p>Scientific knowledge of the geologic history of Vesuvius comes from core samples taken from a 2,000 m (6,600 ft)
      plus borehole on the flanks of the volcano, extending into Mesozoic rock. Cores were dated by potassium–argon and
      argon–argon dating. The area has been subject to volcanic activity for at least 400,000 years; the lowest
      layer of eruption material from the Somma caldera lies on top of the 40,000-year‑old Campanian ignimbrite produced
      by the Campi Flegrei complex. The volcanic complex stands on a large, sedimentary plain.
   </p>

   <p>25,000 years ago: Vesuvius started forming in the Codola Plinian eruption.
      Vesuvius was then built up by a series of lava flows, with some smaller explosive eruptions interspersed between
      them. By this time, the volcano was 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) tall, with the summit being 500 meters (1,640 feet)
      east of the current summit.
      About 19,000 years ago: the style of eruption changed to a sequence of large explosive and caldera-forming Plinian
      eruptions, of which the AD 79 one was the most recent. The calderas are aligned in a roughly east-west direction,
      and all contributed to forming present-day's Somma caldera. The eruptions are named after the tephra deposits
      produced by them, which in turn are named after the place where the deposits were first identified:
      18,300 years ago: the Basal Pumice (Pomici di Base) eruption, VEI 6, the original formation of the Somma caldera.
      The caldera's formation was asymmetric towards the west. The eruption was followed by a period of much
      less violent, lava-producing eruptions.
      16,000 years ago: the Green Pumice (Pomici Verdoline) eruption, VEI 5.
      Around 11,000 years ago: the Lagno Amendolare eruption, smaller than the Mercato eruption.
      8,000 years ago: the Mercato eruption (Pomici di Mercato) – also known as Pomici Gemelle or Pomici Ottaviano, VEI
      6.
      Around 5,000 years ago: two explosive eruptions smaller than the Avellino eruption.
      3,800 years ago: the Avellino eruption (Pomici di Avellino), VEI 6; its vent was apparently 2 km (1.2 mi) west of
      the current crater and the eruption destroyed several Bronze Age settlements of the Apennine culture. Several
      carbon dates on wood and bones offer a range of possible dates of about 500 years in the mid-2nd millennium BC. In
      May 2001, near Nola, Italian archaeologists using the technique of filling every cavity with plaster or substitute
      compound, recovered some remarkably well-preserved forms of perishable objects, such as fence rails, a bucket and
      especially in the vicinity, thousands of human footprints pointing into the Apennines to the north. The settlement
      had huts, pots and goats. The residents had hastily abandoned the village, leaving it to be buried under pumice
      and ash in much the same way that Pompeii and Herculaneum were later preserved. Pyroclastic surge deposits
      were distributed to the northwest of the vent, travelling as far as 15 km (9.3 mi) from it, and lie up to 3 m (9.8
      ft) deep in the area now occupied by Naples.
   </p>

   <p>The volcano then entered a stage of more frequent, but less violent eruptions, until the most recent Plinian
      eruption, which destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum. Evidence of these eruptions comes from badly preserved ashfall
      deposits that have been dubitatively assigned to Either the Somma-Vesuvius complex, or the Phlegrean fields.
      The last of these may have been in 217 BC. There were earthquakes in Italy during that year and the sun was
      reported as being dimmed by gray haze or dry fog. Plutarch wrote of the sky being on fire near Naples, and Silius
      Italicus mentioned in his epic poem Punica that Vesuvius had thundered and produced flames worthy of Mount
      Etna in that year. However, both authors were writing around 250 years later. Greenland ice core samples of around
      that period show relatively high acidity, which is assumed to have been caused by atmospheric hydrogen
      sulfide.
