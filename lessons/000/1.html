   <h1>Vesuvius facts</h1>

   <!-- content start -->

   <p>Mount Vesuvius (/vɪˈsuːviəs/ viss-OO-vee-əs; Italian: Vesuvio [veˈzuːvjo, -ˈsuː-]; Neapolitan: 'O Vesuvio [o
      vəˈsuːvjə], also 'A muntagna or 'A montagna; Latin: Vesuvius [wɛˈsʊwɪ.ʊs], also Vesevius, Vesvius or
      Vesbius is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about 9 km (5.6 mi) east of
      Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes forming the Campanian volcanic arc.
      Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera, resulting from the
      collapse of an earlier, much higher structure.
   </p>
   
   <p>The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis, Stabiae, and
      several other settlements. The eruption ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33 km
      (21 mi), erupting molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6×105 cubic metres (7.8×105 cu yd) per
      second. More than 1,000 people are thought to have died in the eruption, though the exact toll is unknown. The
      only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian
      Tacitus.
   </p>
   
   <p>Vesuvius has erupted many times since and is the only volcano on Europe's mainland to have erupted within the last
      hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population
      of 3,000,000 people living near enough to be affected by an eruption, with 600,000 in the danger zone, making
      it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world. It has a tendency towards violently explosive eruptions,
      which are now known as Plinian eruptions.
