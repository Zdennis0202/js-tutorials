   <h1>Vesuvius facts</h1>

   <!-- content start -->

   <p>Mount Vesuvius (/vɪˈsuːviəs/ viss-OO-vee-əs; Italian: Vesuvio [veˈzuːvjo, -ˈsuː-]; Neapolitan: 'O Vesuvio [o
      vəˈsuːvjə], also 'A muntagna or 'A montagna; Latin: Vesuvius [wɛˈsʊwɪ.ʊs], also Vesevius, Vesvius or
      Vesbius is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about 9 km (5.6 mi) east of
      Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes forming the Campanian volcanic arc.
      Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera, resulting from the
      collapse of an earlier, much higher structure.
   </p>

   <p>The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis, Stabiae, and
      several other settlements. The eruption ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33 km
      (21 mi), erupting molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6×105 cubic metres (7.8×105 cu yd) per
      second. More than 1,000 people are thought to have died in the eruption, though the exact toll is unknown. The
      only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian
      Tacitus.
   </p>

   <p>Vesuvius has erupted many times since and is the only volcano on Europe's mainland to have erupted within the last
      hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population
      of 3,000,000 people living near enough to be affected by an eruption, with 600,000 in the danger zone, making
      it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world. It has a tendency towards violently explosive
      eruptions,
      which are now known as Plinian eruptions.
   </p>

   <p> Vesuvius has a long historic and literary tradition. It was considered a divinity of the Genius type at the time
      of the eruption of AD 79: it appears under the inscribed name Vesuvius as a serpent in the decorative frescos of
      many
      lararia, or household shrines, surviving from Pompeii. An inscription from Capua to IOVI VESVVIO indicates that he
      was worshipped as a power of Jupiter; that is, Jupiter Vesuvius.
   </p>

   <p>The Romans regarded Mount Vesuvius to be devoted to Hercules. The historian Diodorus Siculus relates a
      tradition that Hercules, in the performance of his labors, passed through the country of nearby Cumae on his way
      to Sicily and found there a place called "the Phlegraean Plain" (Φλεγραῖον πεδίον, "plain of fire"), "from a hill
      which anciently vomited out fire ... now called Vesuvius." It was inhabited by giant bandits, "the sons of the
      Earth. With the gods' assistance, he pacified the region and continued. The facts behind the tradition, if any,
      remain unknown, as does whether Herculaneum was named after it. An epigram by the poet Martial in 88 AD suggests
      that both Venus, patroness of Pompeii, and Hercules were worshipped in the region devastated by the eruption of
      79.
