   <h2>My First Heading</h2>
   <p>Vesuvius has erupted many times since and is the only volcano on Europe's mainland to have erupted within the last
      hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population
     <br> of 3,000,000 people living near enough to be affected by an eruption, with 600,000 in the danger zone, making it
      the most densely populated volcanic region in the world. It has a tendency towards violently explosive eruptions,
      which are now known as Plinian eruptions.</p>
